Document preview items are used to add visual interest and substance to a PDF-heavy list layout. The thumbnail is a preview of the PDF cover image. Document previews should also be used for lists of forms, or in other places where the document is an essential subject.

## When to use
- Use when there are 1-6 items in a short section or layout that needs visual interest <br> _Ex: [Statutes page]( https://www.fec.gov/data/legal/statutes/)_

## When to consider something else
- If there are more than six items in the list, or if there is significant metadata useful for telling items apart, consider a feed
