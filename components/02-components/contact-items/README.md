Contact items provide a consistent visual and structural format for content information. The icon should represent the method of contact or delivery.

- By physical mail: `contact-item--mail`
- By email: `contact-item--email`
- By phone: `contact-item--phone`
- By hand-delivery: `contact-item--hand`
- By fax: `contact-item--fax`

## When to use
- Use contact items when the design presents a list of possible contact methods <br> _Ex: [Submit a question to RAD page](https://www.fec.gov/help-candidates-and-committees/question-rad/)_
- Use when there is a single contact item that needs higher visibility as an available resource <br> _Ex: [Contact us page](https://www.fec.gov/contact-us/); [Advisory opinion process page](https://www.fec.gov/legal-resources/advisory-opinions-process/)_

## When to consider something else
- When there is only one recommended or possible method of contact, it may be more appropriate to display the contact information inline with the text or instructions.
