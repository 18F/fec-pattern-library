## Selecting styles
- Use `button--sm` for small-sized controls that need to fit in small spaces, like [pagination components](/components/detail/pagination) under data tables and lists.
- Use `button--lg` for large-sized main, high-hierarchy page controls, like the [final opinion document button](https://www.fec.gov/data/legal/advisory-opinions/2017-13/) above a table of AO documents.
