Collapsible panels provide users with the ability to expand and collapse content as needed. They can simplify the interface by hiding content until it is needed.

## When to use
- Users only need a few specific pieces of content within a page.
- Information needs to be displayed in a small space.

## When to consider something else
- If visitors need to see most or all of the information on a page. Use well-formatted text instead.
- If there is not enough content to warrant condensing. Accordions increase cognitive load and interaction cost, as users have to make decisions about what headers to click on.
