## Gandhi serif

Gandhi serif is our primary font across the site, used for paragraph copy and main headlines. We sought out a serif that had medium contrast for best web and print readability, a strong bold weight that could be used for clear headline hierarchy, and felt traditional and dependable, without much embellishment to distract the eye. The font also needed to be free, and without licensing restrictions on distribution or use so that it would be aligned in values with an open source project.

In our initial research, we heard from the FEC IT and multimedia teams that **they needed a design that held up in both print and web environments** so it would be easy to put print publications online, and easy to print publications directly from the web.

- Gandhi was designed by a publishing company especially for this scenarioâ€”it ranks high in readability both on web and when printed. Many FEC website users often print pages of the FEC website for reference, and this font was specifically designed to perform well in that scenario.

**We also needed to prepare to support multiple languages.**
- Gandhi specifically has excellent Spanish language character support

## Karla

Karla is our secondary font used across the site. We use in data tables, visualizations, and footnote-like text, to keep a clear visual distinction from paragraph and headline copy. To balance the traditional feel of Gandhi, we sought out a modern sans serif with a clean, airy feeling, and wider spacing built in. We were especially critical in choosing a font that had precise, unembellished numerals, since we knew it would be used for financial data. There is also high contrast between the regular and bold weights, which allows us to combine them in table designs, and retain clear hierarchy with just one font. Karla is also an open source font, and free to use.

## Other background on typography

**In early interviews, we heard from FEC staff that they wanted clear design guidelines that helped make the new styles easy to achieve, and hard to get wrong.**

- One way we wanted to support this through typography was to keep the number of fonts in the system low, so that it was easier to know which font to use when. We also specifically chose fonts that had few (but just enough) differences in weights to choose from. Both Karla and Gandhi only have two weights: Regular and Bold, each with matching italics.
